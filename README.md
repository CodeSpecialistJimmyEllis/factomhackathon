# factomhackathon


This is the Factom Smart Contract Hackathon that won third place $1500 dollars.


This project calls the factom blockchain API and writes information to it. It then uses that information to write a smart contract and 
then displays that smart contract on the screen.

This app is about insurance and car sharing. What happens when you need usage based insurance on cars that you borrow or use for a short
period of time. This program is a simulation of this.
